In the winter time we go
Walking in the fields of snow;
Where there is no grass at all;
Where the top of every wall,
Is as white as white can be.
Pointing out the way we came,
-Every one of them the same-
Prints in silver filigree;
And our mothers always know,
By the footprints in the snow,
Where it is the children go.
 Have a good day lv-235!
